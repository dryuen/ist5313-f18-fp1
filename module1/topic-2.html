					<h2>Types of Measurement</h2>
					<p>Measurement is simple when you do it correctly. There are different types of measurement in cooking. We will start with the basics.</p>
					<h3>Liquid Measurement</h3>
					<p>When measuring liquids, you will use either a plastic or glass measuring cup. These are see-through so you can see exactly where the liquid will line up to. They have a handle and a spout to easily pour in liquids. The common measurements for liquid measuring cups are usually by cups, with increments showing fourths and thirds. You can get liquid measuring cups in the following sizes:</p>
					<ul class="list-inline" style="font-size:15px;">
					<li>8 cup</li>
					<li>4 cup</li>
					<li>2 cup</li>
					<li>1 cup</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Dry Ingredients</h3>
					<p>Measuring cups can be used for dry ingredients such as flour, rice, sugar, butter, oats, etc.  You can find either plastic or metal cups and they will usually come in a set of sizes. When using a dry measuring cup, fill up the cup, then use a straight edge (the back of a knife works well) to take off the excess ingredients. The sizes you can find are as follows:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-inline"style="font-size:15px;">
					<li>1/4 cup</li>
					<li>1/3 cup</li>
					<li>1/2 cup</li>
					<li>2/3 cup</li>
					<li>3/4 cup</li>
					<li>1 cup</li>
					</ul>
					<h3> Measuring Spoons</h3>
					<p>	When measuring small amounts of dry and liquid ingredients, it is useful to have two sets of measuring spoons. There are round measuring spoons and rectangular measuring spoons. Rectangular spoons are useful for getting into small spice jars. Measuring spoons usually come in the following sizes as a set, though there are other sizes available: </p>
					<ul class="list-inline" style="font-size:15px;">
					<li>1/4 teaspoon</li>
					<li>1/2 teaspoon</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Scale</h3>
					<p>Kitchen scales are useful for precise measurements of ingredients, especially dry ingredients such as flour. There can be a major disparity in how much is used depending on if it is packed in or if it is looser. Also, scales can do conversions!

			<h3>Instant Read Thermometer</h3>
					<p>Having an instant-read thermometer is critical for making sure meat is cooked to safe temperatures. It is one of the most important tools to have when cooking your turkey on Thanksgiving! There are many out there, but you can find one at the grocery store for under $10. Make sure to wash the thermometer each time it is used to avoid passing bacteria from one meat to another.
					</p>
			<h3>Timer</h3>
					<p>Okay, this one is a given. Every recipe needs to be cooked for a certain amount of time. There are MANY timers out there, including some that are on ovens. If you are not near your kitchen though, it may be useful to set a timer on your phone...after all… it wouldn’t be fun for your smoke alarm to go off would it? Speaking of which…
					</p>
					<p> Make sure your smoke alarm has batteries… you want to be prepared just in case!</p>

    			<p>Hello. This is Janet and I am here to talk to you about different thermometers that you might use in your kitchen.</p>
				<p>The first one that you would probably use is what we call a meat thermometer. As you can see it has a big dial and it only has the levels of different types of meat that you would actually cook. This is a thermometer that can actually be put in the oven while the product is cooking.</p>
				<p>This thermometer is called a bi-metallic stemmed or instant read or analog thermometer. As you can see it has a dial and there is a number on there and you do have to calibrate this thermometer and we’ll talk about this later.</p>
				<p>The other type of thermometer is a digital thermometer. It is also an instant read thermometer and it gives you the numbers you can actually see. You don’t have to actually look at a dial. And as you can see, we’ll talk about how and where to put the thermometers in the product that you’re going to be testing.</p>
				<p>Another thermometer that you might find out, there’s also another digital a type of digital thermometer. And this is one that can also be actually put in the oven and cooked in the product while it’s preparing. And it’s also a digital thermometer and as you can see you get a big readable LCD number.</p>
				<p>We mentioned calibrating a thermometer. If you can get one that you can calibrate it is ideal because that way you can make sure it’s accurate. If it is not calibratable you may have to just purchase one because they do come calibrated from the manufacturer. But this is one that allows you to calibrate it. It’s self-contained in that does not require any other tools. As you can see, it has a built in holder where your nut would go. This is your calibration nut. You would simply slide it through the slot until it is aligned. And then, I don’t know if you can see this, but there is a little dimple here on the thermometer.</p>
				<p>When you are taking temperatures that dimple has to be completely submerged in your solution. And all it requires is a glass of water with crushed or cubed ice. And you want to insert your probe so that that dimple is below the level of the water and then all you have to do is turn and read your dial and make sure that it is set to 32 degrees fahrenheit while it is in the submerged solution. And leave it there for about 15 - 30 seconds to make sure it is not there yet.</p>
				<p>Let’s talk for a few minutes about the different temperatures that you need to cook meats to. </p>
				<p>With poultry, it normally has a lot of bacteria associated with it and this is regardless of the form of the poultry whether it is a turkey, a hen, a chicken, if it is ground, it doesn’t matter. The temperature that the United States Department of Ag. recommends is about 180 degrees. And you’re talking about at the thigh. You will also hear a minimum internal temperature of 165. That is normally from FDA but both temperatures are safe. And one of the reasons USDA goes with a higher temperature is because a lot of times you may not have a thermometer that is calibrated correctly and they want you to err on the side of safety.</p>
				<p>When you’re doing ground meat like fish or ground beef, you generally do a temperature of about 155 degrees. When you’re doing whole cuts of meat like steaks and roasts it is about 145 and your whole seafood is also 145. So, if you’re not sure about those temperatures and not sure, you can always purchase a meat thermometer which will actually give you those temperatures on there with the type of meat that it is. So, that way you will be able to actually just look at that thermometer and see the recommended temperature that you should cook that meat to to make it safe.</p>
				<p>Let’s talk about the proper placement if you are going to be using a meat thermometer in your bird that you will put in the oven. But before we do that, let me point this out. As you can see this is a pop up temperature indicator that comes in your product. This is for reference purposes. To be sure, you would want to make sure you are taking that temperature using your instant read thermometer after it has popped up to ensure that it is cooked to the right temperature.</p>
				<p>When you’re doing your raw bird using your meat thermometer, if you’re going to take the temperature in the breast, you would want to make sure you’re inserting it into the breast. Try to make sure you do not touch a bone. And then the other thing that you want to do is make sure it does not touch the pan as well. The breast should measure at about 175 degrees. If you would want to do it in the thigh, you would want to insert it into your thigh, again not touching the bone. And, like we said, USDA recommends about 180 degrees internal for your thigh.</p>
				<p>Let’s talk about taking the temperature of your bird with an instant read thermometer. There’s a dimple on there and you want to make sure that when you insert your thermometer you have it at the correct location in the bird. And you would want to, if you’re doing the breast, insert the thermometer into the bird so that it goes below or is past that dimple, that it does not touch the bone, or wouldn’t be able to touch the pan because it will be hotter. And you’ll want to let the temperature sit there for a few minutes, a couple of seconds really, to make sure that you reach the right internal temperature and that it is not moving around. And from this temperature, it is not fully cooked. If you want to check your temperature at the thigh, again you would insert it into the thigh, below the dimple so that it is not touching the bone or the pan and again, wait a couple of seconds to make sure you’re getting a constant reading. And, from this temperature we can see that we need to continue to cook this.</p>
				<p>When you’re cooking your meals, you may have some casseroles or some mixed vegetable dishes and your directions will tell you to cook it for 350 degrees for say 25 to 30 minutes or until it’s bubbly or brown. But what’s the internal temperature there? Well, we do have recommendations for you on what that proper temperature should be. So as you see, we have a casserole here. And you would still want to take the temperature using your instant read thermometer. Make sure again that it is inserted below your dimple and you would just stick it into to the side of your product making sure that it is going below the dimple and not touching your container. And you’re actually looking for a temperature of about 135 degrees or higher. That means that those ingredients have been cooked to the right minimum internal temperature.</p>
				<p>When preparing your meal you might want to stuff your bird. That’s not recommended. It’s better to prepare your stuffing outside of the bird, make sure it’s cooked to 165, because if you stuff it, you may get uneven cooking and it may not cook together as well and you may end up with dry product. Now you can use aromatic herbs and vegetables but you would still want to make sure those, the vegetables, are cooked to an internal temperature of 165, because you’re putting it in poultry. You also can stuff other meats like stuffed pork chops. You can also stuff mushrooms, and you will want to make sure that those stuffings are cooked to an internal temperature of 165. Enjoy!</p>
