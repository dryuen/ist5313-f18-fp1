					<h2>Set or Open Stock?</h2>
					<p>Look at your budget and your intended uses, most likely you will be able to purchase good open stock pieces and add as you grow your set. Don't spend a lot of money on a subpar set when you may not use all of the pieces.  Some cooks decide that they prefer nonstick skillets, stainless stock pots, and ceramic saute pans. You won't find that in one set.  This is only possible when buying open stock.</p>
					<h3>Conduction</h3>
					<p> Induction cooktops require magnetic properties in cookware. Remember this when shopping.</p> 
					<p>Heat is transferred from the molecules on the cooktop to the molecules in the pan. The heat from the bottom of the pan transfers from the top and then into the food inside the pan.</p>
					<h3>Surface</h3>
					<h4>Is the surface ‘Coated’ or ‘Cladded”?</h4>
					<p> A clad surface may be layers of stainless steel on the inside and outside with other metals in the center, often aluminum or copper to conduct heat.</p>
					<h4>Hard- Anodized</h4>
					<p>Aluminum has been changed into a hard surface. This is not a ‘non-stick’ surface.</p>
					<h4>Stainless Steel</h4>
					<p>Long lasting and durable, these pans are good for browning meats. The pans provide uniform cooking and heat up rapidly. They are broiler and dishwasher safe and with induction cooktops. Con- Might be difficult to clean if burned.</p>
					<h4>Nonstick</h4>
					<p>Durable surface coatings that release even delicate foods with no effort. Good for low and no fat cooking. Easy to clean and can be oven safe depending on handles.  Con: May scratch if incorrect utensils are used. Not always dishwasher safe.</p>

			<h4>Ceramic</h4>
			<p>A non-stick ceramic (or fire hardened clay) coating is applied to a metal pan base. The coating is typically made from inorganic minerals, primarily silicon and oxygen. Coating is environmentally friendly and heat resistant to 842F.   Cons- Recommend to wash by hand using only a mild detergent in hot water with a dishcloth or sponge.  Cook on low to medium heat.  Use  only plastic or wooden spoons. </p>
			<h4>Copper</h4>
			<p>Heavy gauge copper provides even cooking and quick cool down. Offers maximum control of heating. Compatible for most cooking tasks. Cons: Not compatible with induction. High price.</p> 
			<h4>Aluminum</h4>
			<p>Excellent conductor at a reasonable price. The pans are strong and lightweight.  Cons: Prone to staining and can cause a bitter taste in food. </p>

    			<p>When cooking in the kitchen, it’s very important to choose the best tools for the job. This will ensure maximum flavor as well as optimal textures.</p> 
				<p>Hi, my name is Alexis and today we’re going to talk about the difference between three common household pans.</p>
				<p>Let’s start with the non-stick pan. This is probably the most common pan for beginner cooks. These are fairly inexpensive and due to their non-stick surface, they are super easy to clean. To increase the longevity of your pan, you need to ensure that you are taking proper care of the non-stick surface. For example, when you’re making scrambled eggs you should always be using silicon or wooden tools. And that goes for all other dishes as well. 
				To get the best results from your non-stick pan, we recommend you cook delicate dishes like eggs, pancakes, grilled cheese, and lighter fish such as tilapia. Proteins like steak, chicken pies, burgers, or salmon aren’t ideal for non-stick pans as those require high heat. If you’re looking for easy clean up and don’t want to make dishes that require high heat, this is the pan for you.</p>
				<p>So now let’s talk about cast iron. I think everybody should own one of these pans. Cast iron pans are exceptionally versatile. These sturdy pans can be used on the stove top as well as in the oven. Cast iron pans are not only affordable, but if you take proper care of them they can last for decades. These long-lasting pans can be used to cook an array of dishes from steak, fruit cobbler and even frittata. 
				You can cook nearly everything with a cast iron pan, but for beginner cooks they may seem intimidating. Pans need to be treated before their first use and the clean up is more involved than with a non-stick pan. If you’re willing to do the clean up, cast iron pans are a worthwhile addition to any kitchen.</p>
				<p>Now let’s talk about our third and final pan. Stainless steel is without a doubt my favorite pan to use in the kitchen. These pans are built tough and like cast iron, can be used on the stove top or in the oven. They’re particularly good when you want a nice sear on a protein. You can truly cook everything with a stainless steel pan: salmon, sauteed vegetables, risotto and even eggs. The fear around using the stainless steel pan is the idea that food will stick. To prevent this, you need to make sure you are using a preheated pan and the appropriate amount of oil.</p>
				<p>So, here I have two chicken pieces and I’m going to show you just how easy it is to make sure your food doesn’t stick.First things first, let’s preheat the pan. I’m going to add about 2 teaspoons of oil, just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Once the oil begins to shimmer, I’m going to add the seasoned chicken, skin side down. I’m going to let the chicken rest in the pan for a few minutes.</p>
				<p> Once the chicken begins to pull away from the pan it should be ready to flip. See, it’s so easy. Check out that beautiful golden skin. I’m going to let them brown for a few more minutes on the other side then I’m going to finish them off in the oven. </p>
				<p>After you remove the chicken from the oven there’s going to be some brown bits at the bottom of the pan. This is called the foundation. At this point you can go ahead and scrub the pan. Or, what I prefer to do is take advantage of the amazing flavor from the chicken fat and make a really simple pan sauce. Reduce the stock for a few minutes, and then add garlic, thyme and a bit of butter and stir. Pour the sauce over the chicken and you’ve got a great easy dinner and a clean pan.
				<p>So, as you can see, stainless steel can do everything that a non-stick and cast iron can do. In my opinion, it’s the most versatile pan out there.</p>
