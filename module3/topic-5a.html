					<h3>Flour</h3>
					<p>If you go to a grocery store to the flour aisle, you will find many different types of flour. Which one do you choose? One important part of flour is how much protein it contains. Flour with a higher percentage of protein will create a harter flours, which are best for chewy crusty breads, flour with lower percentage of protein are best. As a beginner baker, your best bet will be to stick with All-Purpose flour.</p> 
					<h3>Leaveners</h3>
					<p>These are what are used to cause baked items to rise. Different leaveners are - Yeast, Baking Soda, Baking Powder. . They are responsible for expanding the air bubbles that have been mixed, creamed, kneaded or whipped into the batter or dough. These millions of bubbles are trapped in the batter by the gluten structure formed and are enlarged by the leavener, either triggered by moisture and/or heat.</p>
					<h3>Sugar</h3>
					<p>There are many types of sugar used in baking. The most common is granulated sugar. There is also powdered sugar, often used for frosting. Brown sugar is sugar with molasses.</p>
