					<h2>Choosing an oven</h2>
					<p>Whether you are a master baker in the kitchen or you just want to make something special for your Valentine, you may be wondering if your current oven is the best one for baking.</p>
					<p>Well wonder no more! You can certainly create some baked masterpieces, no matter what type of oven you have! However, each type comes with some need-to-know info to make the best out of its baking capabilities. Here we will outline all the pros and cons for electric, and convection ovens for baking. Learn which one is best for you.</p> 
					
					<h2 class="text-center">Electric</h2> 
				 <div class="row">
			     <div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3 class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline;text-align:center;">Pros</h3>
 					<p>Because the electric coils heat and cool slowly, the radiant heat that is produced is fairly steady and even, with fewer spikes and drops in the temperature.</p>
					<p>The inside of an electric oven remains dry, which helps food crisp up and turn golden brown.</p>
					<p>When the coils are completely on, it’s a less intense heat, so you don’t have to worry as much about the undersides of your food burning.</p>
					<p>Electric ovens cost considerably less than gas ovens.</p>
								
				 </div>
			      <div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3 class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline;text-align:center;">Pros</h3>
					<p>Unlike gas heat, the electric coils take a little while to heat up to the full temperature.</p>
					<p>Your food can easily over-brown in an electric oven.</p>
					
					</div>	
					</div>
					<h2 class="text-center">Convection</h2> 
		         	<div class="row">
			      <div class="col-sm-6">
				  	<h3 class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline;text-align:center;">Pros</h3>
					<p>Because of its third heating element and fan, the hot air directly around the food is steadily maintained.</p>
					<p>Your food cooks quicker than with other ovens.</p>
					<p>Your food is cooked more evenly than with other ovens.</p>
				   </div>
			  <div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3 class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline;text-align:center;">Pros</h3>
					<p>Because “convection” is typically a setting on the oven, when it’s turned off, the same issues arise as with using a conventional oven for baking as an electric.</p> 
					<p>Ovens with a convection setting are generally more expensive than conventional ovens.</p>
					</div>					
					</div>
					<h2 class="text-center">Preheating</h2> 
		         	<div class="row">
			      	<div class="col-sm-6">

					<h3 class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline;text-align:center;">Electric</h3>
					<p>Since the coils need to take some time to warm up, consider preheating longer than you may think is necessary, to ensure an optimal temperature.</p>
			
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3 class="font-weight-bold" style="text-decoration: underline;text-align:center;">Convection</h3>
					<p>Because it cooks the food so efficiently, lower the temperature that a recipe calls for by 25 degrees.</p>

				<p>The problem with conventional ovens is that hot air rises, so the upper half of the oven will always be warmer than the lower half. So if you put in two sheets of cookies the top will cook faster than the bottom rack. In our tests, the top of the oven was a full 30 degrees hotter than the bottom. Convection oven, to the rescue. Convection ovens use a fan to circulate the air within the oven to equalize the temperature. So, no matter where you place your dish, or how many dishes you cook at the same time, they all cook evenly. But that’s not the only benefit. Since more hot air comes in contact with the food your dishes cook faster, so you’ll have to adjust your recipes accordingly. Some ovens will auto adjust the temperature for you, otherwise you have to do it yourself. Usually that means reducing the temperature by about 25 degrees, or reducing the overall cooking time by 20 percent. Get to know your oven so you know exactly how to adjust your recipes. Once you have the math figured out the benefits of convection cooking are huge. For baked goods butter will release steam quickly and this means the results will be flakery, lighter, and fluffier. With roasts the fat will render quickly sealing in those delicious juices leaving an evenly brown and crispy skin without all that constant basting. There are a few catches. First, not all foods agree with convection cooking. Souffles and delicate cakes are just too delicate for all that hot air blowing at their batter. You'll need to adjust the fan speed or disable the convection feature completely. Second, there’s the cost. More parts cost more money, usually hundreds of dollars. It’s not a cheap upgrade, but if spending less time in the kitchen is worth your while, a fan in the oven might be exactly what you need.</p>
