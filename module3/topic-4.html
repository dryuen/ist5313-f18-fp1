					<h2>Conversions and Substitutions</h2>
					<p>	Want to make some cookies, but don’t have any eggs? Use some applesauce!</p>
					<p> One of the really neat things about baking, is there are so many substitutions available. This is extremely helpful for people who have food allergies, and it also comes in handy when you may not have certain items on hand. 
					<p>Here are some common food substitutions...note the differences in amounts.</p>
					<h4>Baking powder</h4>
					<p>1 teaspoon = 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar.</p>
					<h4>Brown sugar</h4>
					<p> 1 cup = 1 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of molasses and remove 1/4 cup of liquid from recipe.</p>
					<h4>Butter (unsalted)</h4>
					<p>1 cup = 1 cup of shortening, lard, or vegetable oil.</p>
					<h4>Chocolate (unsweetened)</h4>
					<p>1 ounce = 3 tablespoons of natural cocoa powder and 1 tablespoon of shortening, vegetable oil or unsalted butter.</p>
					<h4>Cream (heavy)</h4>
					<p>1 cup = 2/3 cup of whole milk and 1/3 cup of unsalted butter.</p>
					<h4>Egg</h4>
					<p>1 egg = 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder mixed with either half a pureed banana or 1/3 cup of applesauce.</p>
					<h4>Flour (self-rising)</h4>
					<p>1 cup = 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.</p>
					<h4>Milk (evaporated whole)</h4>
					<p> 1 cup = 1 cup of half-and-half.</p>
					<h4>Milk (sweet condensed)</h4>
					<p>: 14 ounce can = 1 cup instant non-fat dry milk, 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of boiling water, and 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter.</p>
					<h4>Vegetable oil</h4>
					<p> 1 cup = 1 cup of apple sauce</p>

					<h3>Altitude</h3>
					<p> The higher the altitude, the lower the air pressure is. This affects how ingredients react with each other.</p>
					<h4>Temperature</h4>
					<p>Increase the temperature 15-25 degrees so that evaporation doesn’t happen as quickly.</p>
					<h4>Time</h4>
					<p>Since baking at a higher temperature, decrease the cooking time by  5-8 minutes for every 30 minutes baking time.</p>
					<h4>Sugar</h4>
					<p>Decrease 1 tablespoon per cup of sugar.
					<h4>Liquid</h4>
					<p>Increase by 1 to 2 tablespoons at 3,000 feet. Increase by 1 1/2 teaspoons for each additional 1,000 feet.</p>

			<h3>Doubling</h3>
					<p> Most ingredients, you would just “double” how much each is. For example- ¾ water if doubling, then it would be 1 2/4 of water. There is an exception though…baking powder and baking soda are used when there is an acidic ingredient.</p> 
					<ul style="list-style-type:none">
					<li>&#9733 1 - 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder per cup of all-purpose flour</li>
					<li>&#9733 1/4 teaspoon baking soda per cup of all-purpose flour</li>
					</ul>
				<p>It’s also best to not substitute ingredients when doubling, if you haven’t before.</p>
				<p>Make sure to cool your baking sheets in between baking batches so that the butter doesn’t melt and affect the texture of the cookies.</p>

    			<p>Baker's percentage is yet another way to express ingredients in a bake shop formula. This measuring system is commonly used when a formula contains flour as its main ingredient, such as in breads, muffins, cookies, and cakes. When the ingredients are expressed as a percentage the baker can quickly see the relationship between ingredients and will know at a glance what kind of product the formula will produce. Baker's percentage also makes it easy to increase or decrease a formula yield. In this method, flour is the main ingredient so it is expressed as 100%. Every other ingredient is expressed as a percentage of the amount of flour in the formula. To
				demonstrate, we will convert this formula for Italian bread to Baker's percentage. The weight of the flour, 32 ounces becomes 100%, so 32 ounces of flour equals 100%. Now divide the weight of the other ingredients by the weight of the flour. 23 ounces of water divided by 32 ounces of flour equals .718, which we round up to .72 or 72%.</p>
    			<p>.56 ounces of salt divided by 32 ounces equals .0175,  which we round to 2% and .56 ounces of yeast divided by 32 ounces equals .0175 or 2%. Looking at this same Italian bread dough formula written in metric measurements will help explain how baker’s percentages are computed.</p>
    			<p>Most bakeshop formulas in metric are based on 1 kilo or 1,000 grams of flour.  In the Italian bread dough formula, 1,000 grams, which is equivalent to slightly more than 2 pounds equals 100%. Notice how the metric system makes the calculation of baker's percentage much simpler. 720 grams of water divided by 1,000 is .72 or 72%. 20 grams of salt and yeast divided by 1,000 is .02 or two%. And finally when working with baker's percentage always calculate the total percentage. That is,  add up all the percentages. In this case the total percentage is 176%.</p>
    			<p>You'll need to know the total percentage when you increase or decrease a formula using Baker's percentage as we'll see shortly.</p>
