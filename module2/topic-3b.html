					<h2>Going to the Store</h2>
					<p>One thing to know about shopping, is how the store is set up. Have you ever noticed that milk and eggs are in the back of the store? This is a tactic to make you walk through the store and buy those unnecessary items! Want to make sure you don’t get side-tracked and buy those triple-stuffed oreos? Many grocery stores now have an option in which you can order your groceries online, and pick them up ready, or you can even have them delivered through apps like Shipt.</p>
					<p>--The first step to making sure you have a successful shopping experience is to have a LIST!! That’s why meal planning is important to do. Once you have your meals planned, you can easily create your grocery list. </p>
					<p>--DON’T GO TO THE STORE HUNGRY! If you do, you will grab so many unnecessary items...like those triple-stuffed oreos.</p>
					<p>--When shopping, make sure to buy non-perishable items first, then work your way through perishable and frozen items.</p> 
					<p>--One thing that is easy to do, is to buy your food in bulk, so you don’t have to go to the store later. If you have 3 meals that involve chicken, buying a larger quantity will save you money than buying 3 small packs.</p>
					<p>--Generic brands can be just as good as name brands. There are some things that I will splurge on for name brand (Oreo’s)... but you can easily get store brand items for a lot less.</p> 
					<p>--How much is the food really worth?? $5 for 3 oz or $6 for 8 oz? Initially, people often look for what’s cheaper, but it’s important to look at the value of the total cost and what you are getting. You can often find on the shopping tag, how much an item costs per ounce. This helps a lot if you want to buy more in bulk.</p>

 				 <h2>Buying Quantity</h2>
 				 <p>At the store, many foods are sold by the pint or by the quart.  Many recipes will ask you to measure those foods by the cup.</p>            
  				<p>Here is a helpful guide</p>
  				<table class="table table-bordered" style="font-size:15px;">
   				 <thead>
      				<tr>
       				<th>Recipe Need</th>
       				<th>Store Qty</th>
       				 </tr>
    			</thead>
   				 <tbody>
     				 <tr>
        				<td>1 Cup</td>
        				<td>1/2 Pint</td>
        			</tr>
     				 <tr>
        				<td>2 Cups</td>
        				<td>1 Pint</td>
       				</tr>
      				<tr>
       					<td>4 Cups</td>
        				<td>2 Pints</td>
        			</tr>
        			<tr>
       					<td>4 Cups</td>
        				<td>1 Quart</td>
        			</tr>
        			<tr>
       					<td>4 Quarts</td>
        				<td>1 Gallon</td>
        			</tr>
    			</tbody>
  			</table>
			<h3>”Sell By”, “Use By”, and “Best By” dates--- what does that mean?</h3>
			<p>“Best by” dates are only a recommendation. The food may have a different texture or flavor after the “best by” date, but it’s still edible.</p>
			<p>“Sell by” is the date that stores would like to have items sold by. The product will usually be good for a few days or weeks after sold. </p>
			<p style="font-style:italic;">Tip-- Often you can get discounts on food items when close to their sell by date!</p>
			<p> “Use by” dates are a safety designation-The product is not safe to eat after this date.</p>
			<p style="font-style:italic;">Tip- Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the slowest shopping days.</p>
