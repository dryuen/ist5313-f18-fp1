					<h2>Choosing a Stovetop</h2>
					<p>Deciding which stovetop to use for cooking can be a confusing and daunting task. Today there are three main stovetops available to all chefs; gas, electric, and induction ranges. Viewing the pros and cons of all three will help determine which is best for you and your cooking needs. 
			<h3 class="text-center">Gas</h3> 
			<div class="row">
			  <div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Pros</h4>
				<h5>Heats Quickly</h5>
				 <p>The flame on a gas stove lights immediately, giving you instant heat and maximum control that you can visually see. No second guessing if the range is at the correct setting or if it has cooled yet.</p> 
				<h5>Fuel Source</h5>
				 <p>Gas stoves are run on propane or natural gas, which can be much cheaper than paying for electricity. </p>
				<h5>Temperature</h5>
	 			<p>Source- The flame used by a natural gas stove allow the user to cool food more evenly and quickly. Giving those who enjoy cooking great satisfaction.</p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Cons</h4> 
				<h5>Flame Stability</h5>
				<p>If you have a window in your kitchen or need to air out a room while cooking a smelly fish, the wind can cause problems for your flame or even extinguish it. </p>
				<h5>Expense</h5>
				<p>An immediate drawback to a gas range can be price. Although a gas range will save money in the long run, the price of a range and the hook up, especially if you do not have a gas line in your kitchen can be pricey.</p> 
			 </div>
			 </div>
			<h3 class="text-center">Electric</h3> 
			<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Pros</h4>
				<h5>Even Surface</h5>
				<p>Most electric ranges sold today have a smooth top. This smooth top allows for more stability when using pots and pans, than the grates on a gas stove. When it is not in use the smooth surface can be used as extra counter space.</p> 
				<h5>Easy Cleanup</h5>
				<p>Since most electric ranges are smooth top it is easy to wipe to clean up most spills; no need to remove a burner ring or wipe up a hardened spill from on top of a gas nozzle.</p>
				<h5>Ignition</h5>
				<p>To turn a burner on, you simply twist its knob and the stovetop element begins heating up immediately. An ignitor is not required to light your burner. An electric oven also heats up faster than a gas oven and heats consistently.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Cons</h4>
				<h5>Power</h5>
				<p>If the power goes out you can’t cook.</p> 
				<h5>Durability</h5>
				<p>If you have a smooth top surface, it could easily crack if something is dropped on it, or if cold water is thrown on a hot surface. The glass also stains easily, which can detract from the look and style of the stove.</p>
				<h5>Cooking time</h5>
				<p>While electric stoves are fairly easy to use and operate, they cook food more slowly than gas stoves do.</p>
				<h5>Cost</h5>
				<p> While installation may be cheaper that a gas stove, in the long run electric stoves do cost more due to the electricity required to operate them. </p>
			</div>
			</div>
			<h3 class="text-center">Induction</h3>
			<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Pros</h4> 
				<h5>Cook time</h5>
				<p>Induction ranges have the fastest cooking technology taking only about 2 to 4 minutes to bring 6 quarts of water to a near boil! 
				<h5>Safety</h5>
				<p>Induction cooktops can get extremely hot, but the heat is transferring from the cooking pot to the glass through conduction, much as a hot pan would transfer some heat to a countertop if you set it down to rest. When the pot is removed from the range, that heating stops. Therefore, the glass surface never gets as hot as it does on a traditional radiant electric range. If you turn a burner on with no pot, the range will not get hot, an amazing safety feature!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
		   		<h4>Cons</h4> 
		   		<h5>Particular Cookware</h5>
		   		<p>If you are switching to induction you may need to throw out your existing arsenal of cookware. Cookware marked “induction compatible” should be the only type of equipment used. Magnets can be used to test if your cookware is already induction friendly, if the magnet sticks strongly to the cookware it is induction compatible.</p>

    			<p>Hey everybody, if you have questions about kitchen appliances, cooktops, ovens, microwaves, I'm here today to share some answers.</p>
    			<p> Now I learned about these products at CES where I met Randy.</p>
				<p> Hi, I'm Randy Overton, National Product Trainer for LG home appliances. In this video I'll be walking through a lot of available styles and features for these appliances. For cooktops the primary consideration is power, so when it comes to a decision of buying a gas cooktop number one's going to be about power. The ability of bringing those pots to boil rapidly or being able to bring a very very low simmer. Going along with power is functionality, the quality of the grates themselves. They’ve got to last. So, cast iron grates, very heavy duty. They're not going to warp over time as they age and  heat up, and the ability to keep them clean. Some kitchens call for a high-end aesthetic, the good news is there are cooktops available that fit the bill with an almost futuristic look, smooth controls, smooth elements, but for most people the question is more a matter of function in space. If you don't go for a built-in cooktop, slide ends are a great alternative. What I mean by slide in is it easily just slides into an existing opening, you don't have to have special cabinetry built to bring this in and it is that all-in-one solution. Depending on your space and cooking needs you can opt for a single or a double oven. So, this is our premium double wall oven in addition to the color and finish your interface has a big impact on the ovens aesthetics very smooth controls, not a lot of buttons in the way gives it a nice clean uncluttered look and this beautiful touchscreen interface for bigger meals. It's important to have an oven with sturdy hardware. You've got this heavy-duty smooth gliding rack, so when you've got those heavier items and you need to stir or turn the food around this is going to hold that steady for you. Certain models have some really cool extra features, this is actually a baking drawer so you could bake the breads ,you could slow cook a pie, for example inside it has more function than simple storage. We all know microwaves are incredibly convenient for heating up easy meals and leftovers, but that doesn't mean they should be an afterthought when designing your kitchen. Your microwave ought to blend in with the aesthetic of your other appliances. We call this kind of a monitor style control. So instead of having them off to the right, just gives you that kind of cool almost a widescreen TV look. Some models deliver valuable features too, like over the range vents to capture rising grime. Smoke and grease tend to start rising up and rising over your cabinetry, a typical over-the-range microwave can't capture a lot of that, so with the simple press of the button the Extenda Vent pulls forward and can capture more of that smoked grease and odor. Here's a neat feature that saves energy and time when preparing meals, this microwave even has a warming lamp, we can actually keep it warm inside without using the microwave. Picking out your kitchen appliances is a big decision and I hope you found this video helpful this has been Shawn, have a great day.</p>
