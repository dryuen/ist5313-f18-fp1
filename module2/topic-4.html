					<h2>Choosing a Stovetop</h2>
					<p>Deciding which stovetop to use for cooking can be a confusing and daunting task. Today there are three main stovetops available to all chefs; gas, electric, and induction ranges. Viewing the pros and cons of all three will help determine which is best for you and your cooking needs. 
			<h3 class="text-center">Gas</h3> 
			<div class="row">
			  <div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Pros</h4>
				<h5>Heats Quickly</h5>
				 <p>The flame on a gas stove lights immediately, giving you instant heat and maximum control that you can visually see. No second guessing if the range is at the correct setting or if it has cooled yet.</p> 
				<h5>Fuel Source</h5>
				 <p>Gas stoves are run on propane or natural gas, which can be much cheaper than paying for electricity. </p>
				<h5>Temperature</h5>
	 			<p>Source- The flame used by a natural gas stove allow the user to cool food more evenly and quickly. Giving those who enjoy cooking great satisfaction.</p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Cons</h4> 
				<h5>Flame Stability</h5>
				<p>If you have a window in your kitchen or need to air out a room while cooking a smelly fish, the wind can cause problems for your flame or even extinguish it. </p>
				<h5>Expense</h5>
				<p>An immediate drawback to a gas range can be price. Although a gas range will save money in the long run, the price of a range and the hook up, especially if you do not have a gas line in your kitchen can be pricey.</p> 
			 </div>
			 </div>
			<h3 class="text-center">Electric</h3> 
			<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Pros</h4>
				<h5>Even Surface</h5>
				<p>Most electric ranges sold today have a smooth top. This smooth top allows for more stability when using pots and pans, than the grates on a gas stove. When it is not in use the smooth surface can be used as extra counter space.</p> 
				<h5>Easy Cleanup</h5>
				<p>Since most electric ranges are smooth top it is easy to wipe to clean up most spills; no need to remove a burner ring or wipe up a hardened spill from on top of a gas nozzle.</p>
				<h5>Ignition</h5>
				<p>To turn a burner on, you simply twist its knob and the stovetop element begins heating up immediately. An ignitor is not required to light your burner. An electric oven also heats up faster than a gas oven and heats consistently.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Cons</h4>
				<h5>Power</h5>
				<p>If the power goes out you can’t cook.</p> 
				<h5>Durability</h5>
				<p>If you have a smooth top surface, it could easily crack if something is dropped on it, or if cold water is thrown on a hot surface. The glass also stains easily, which can detract from the look and style of the stove.</p>
				<h5>Cooking time</h5>
				<p>While electric stoves are fairly easy to use and operate, they cook food more slowly than gas stoves do.</p>
				<h5>Cost</h5>
				<p> While installation may be cheaper that a gas stove, in the long run electric stoves do cost more due to the electricity required to operate them. </p>
			</div>
			</div>
			<h3 class="text-center">Induction</h3>
			<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h4>Pros</h4> 
				<h5>Cook time</h5>
				<p>Induction ranges have the fastest cooking technology taking only about 2 to 4 minutes to bring 6 quarts of water to a near boil! 
				<h5>Safety</h5>
				<p>Induction cooktops can get extremely hot, but the heat is transferring from the cooking pot to the glass through conduction, much as a hot pan would transfer some heat to a countertop if you set it down to rest. When the pot is removed from the range, that heating stops. Therefore, the glass surface never gets as hot as it does on a traditional radiant electric range. If you turn a burner on with no pot, the range will not get hot, an amazing safety feature!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
		   		<h4>Cons</h4> 
		   		<h5>Particular Cookware</h5>
		   		<p>If you are switching to induction you may need to throw out your existing arsenal of cookware. Cookware marked “induction compatible” should be the only type of equipment used. Magnets can be used to test if your cookware is already induction friendly, if the magnet sticks strongly to the cookware it is induction compatible.</p>

    			<p>Hey everybody, if you have questions about kitchen appliances, cooktops, ovens, microwaves, I'm here today to share some answers.</p>
    			<p> Now I learned about these products at CES where I met Randy.</p>
				<p> Hi, I'm Randy Overton, National Product Trainer for LG home appliances. In this video I'll be walking through a lot of available styles and features for these appliances.</p>
				<p> For cooktops the primary consideration is power, so when it comes to a decision of buying a gas cooktop number one's going to be about power. The ability of bringing those pots to boil rapidly or being able to bring a very very low simmer.</p>
				<p> Going along with power is functionality, the quality of the grates themselves.</p>
