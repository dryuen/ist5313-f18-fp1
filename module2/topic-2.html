					<h2>Basic Steps to Food Safety</h2>
					<p>After consuming a scrumptious meal, the last thing anyone wants to think about is contracting some sort of foodborne illness due to improper food handling techniques. To safeguard yourself and your loved ones from food poisoning, always keep these four practices in mind when preparing meals at home:</p>
					<h3>1. Clean</h3>
					<p>Though not visible to the naked eye, pesky bacteria and viruses can reside on countertops, cutting boards, and other surfaces that are commonly used in the kitchen. In fact, they even live on reusable grocery bags, various foods and of course, your hands. To prevent these and other unwelcome microbes from taking up residence in your kitchen (and inside your body), always:</p>
					<h4>Wash Your Hands</h4>
					<p>A good rule of thumb is to wash your hands for 20 seconds before and after you prepare each meal.</p>
					<h4>Sanitize Surfaces</h4>
					<p>Wash countertops, cutting boards, and other surfaces after preparing foods, especially after handling raw meat.</p>
					<h4>Rinse Fruits and Vegetables</h4>
					<p> Before eating, cutting, or cooking fresh fruits and vegetables, thoroughly rinse them under running water.</p>
					<p style="font-style:italic;">Quick Tip: A solution of 1 tbsp of unscented chlorine bleach in a gallon of water is effective for sanitizing food contact surfaces.</p>
					<h3>2. Separate</h3>
					<p>Bacteria such as salmonella and E.coli can easily be transferred from foods like raw meat, poultry, and eggs, to other foods, your hands and even surfaces. To avoid cross-contamination, keep foods apart while shopping and of course, when preparing meals:</p>
					<h4>When Shopping</h4>
					<p>Always grab a plastic produce bag or two to separate raw meat from fruits and vegetables, and other food items in your cart, even if they are prepackaged. Prepackaged trays are prone to tearing and can leak meat drippings onto other food items.</p>
					<h4>During Cooking</h4> 
					<p>Designate one cutting board for raw meat, seafood, etc. and another one for produce.</p>
					<p style="font-style:italic;">Quick Tip: When shopping for a meat cutting board, consider selecting one with grooves for the juices to run into.</p>

      				<td>140</td>
      				</tr>
      				
    			</tbody>
  			</table>
			<h3>3. Cook</h3>
					<p>Always check the food safety handling labels before cooking to determine the recommended minimum internal temperature for preparing meat, poultry, seafood,etc. Instead of having to guesstimate whether your meat and poultry is done, use an instant-read meat thermometer to guarantee that it is safe to eat.</p> 
					<p style="font-style:italic;">Quick Tip: Stick the meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat to accurately check for doneness. Don’t forget to remove it from the food after you’ve read the temperature (and wash it before and after use)!</p>
					<h3>4. Chill</h3>
					<p>Properly refrigerate all meat immediately after you return home from your grocery shopping trip. Also, ensure that foods are stored at the appropriate temperatures listed below:</p>
					<ul style="font-size:15px;">
					<li>Keep the refrigerator temperature at or below 40° F (4° C).</li>
					<li>The freezer temperature should be 0° F (-18° C).</li>
					<li>Marinate food in the refrigerator.</li>
					<li>Keep foods covered.</li>
					</ul>

    			<p>Hi. This is Ann. Today I’m going to share five ways you may be making your family sick at dinner.
				<p>Mistake # 1: Not washing your hands before preparing meals. Sure your home kitchen is not just like a restaurant kitchen, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do what professional cooks are required to do. For example, wash your hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds and dry your hands on a clean towel. Also, wash your hands after handling dirty dishes or garbage.</p>
				<p>Mistake # 2: Is the fancy sounding cross-contaminating utensil. If you change between meat and vegetables, or fruit, you want to make sure you use a new cutting board and a new knife. Or, you want to wash that knife and cutting board with warm, soapy water.</p>
				<p>Mistake # 3: Keeping a dirty sponge around. Kitchen sponges are the number one breeding ground for germs in your home. If you use one, you want to make sure you rotate them frequently. And one good tip is that you can wet the sponge, put it in the microwave for two minutes and that will kill all disease-causing bacteria.</p>
				<p>Mistake # 4: Not wiping down surfaces after food preparation. Unwashed countertops can transmit live bacteria. Scrub and sanitize all food prep surfaces, especially after preparing raw meat. And don’t use a dirty rag or sponge while cleaning surfaces. You’ll just be spreading germs around.</p>
				<p>Mistake # 5: Not washing your hands after handling raw meat. Beef, chicken, pork, eggs, and fish are loaded with bacteria. Everytime you touch them your hand gets loaded too. Do a full, thorough hand washing before going on to the next part of the meal preparation. </p>
				<p>Okay, that’s our five. We cannot promise that it’ll make them like everything that you cook, but it will help them avoid getting sick in other ways.</p>
