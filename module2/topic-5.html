					<h2>Read Twice Prep Once</h2>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO READ THE WHOLE RECIPE BEFORE COOKING- TWICE!<br/> This is important to do for many reasons.</p>
					<ol style="font-size:18px;">
					<li>There may be ingredients to be used that are not in the ingredient list (Ex: water).</li>
					<li>You may need a specific tool, pot, or pan.</li>
					<li>There may be a technique for cutting, or cooking that you have not done before. (Ex: Do onions need to be chopped or diced? </li>
					<li>Ingredients may need to be split for different uses. (Ex: ½ cup butter for one part, then ½ for another?</li>
					<li>The oven may need to pre preheated.</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="font-size:18px;">Once you have read the entire recipe, make sure to gather all of the equipment, then gather all ingredients. Make sure to follow the recipe step by step. If you are new to cooking, it is best to not use substitutions. </p>

    			<p>Today we're gonna work on reading a recipe. So today we're gonna make monster cookies. The first thing you want to do is look at your recipe and make sure you have all the ingredients. So we need to make sure that we have margarine, brown sugar, sugar, eggs, light corn syrup, baking soda, peanut butter, vanilla, oatmeal, M&Ms, and chocolate chips.</p>
				<p>So I've already went through my cupboards and made sure that I had all of those ingredients. Then  you're gonna look on your recipe and see what temperature to preheat the oven.Preheating means to turn it on so that it gets warm before we're ready to use it. So this says that they bake at 350 so I'm gonna turn my oven on to 350 degrees,now the oven will be ready when we're ready for it.</p>
				<p>All right let's go back and read the recipe. It says cream together sugars and margarine, so we have to look at how much of each ingredient so one stick  margarine that's easy because it comes in one stick, but sugar says one cup, brown sugar and one cup sugar those are what these are right here. These are our cups these are our spoons so you want to look at what it says on the sides of the cups. See I have a quarter cup, a half a cup, and one cup. We know that we need 1 cup brown sugar. All right with brown sugar you want to make sure that it's it's patted down really well in the cup so that when you dump it in the bowl it comes out the same shape of the cup. That means you patted it down really well. Now I'm also going to do a cup of regular sugar all right with regular sugar and all the other you want to bring it right you want to fill the cup. This is exactly one cup and it's filled right up to the top so I'm going to dump that in with the brown sugar and then add the one stick of butter it then said to cream together. Okay I am now creaming together the sugar and the butter like the recipe told me to The next step in our recipe says beat in eggs one at a time. All right I have added in the eggs one at a time so now it's a creamy mixture so I'm gonna go back to our recipe to see what's next.</p> 
				<p>You can see that I'm going back to the recipe for every step so the next step is stir in vanilla and corn syrup so we go back  to the front to see exactly how much to put in.  So vanilla is one teaspoon, those are our spoons TSP is for tea TBSP would be for tablespoon but you can see right on the spoons it either says TSP or TBSP we want 1 tsp vanilla 1 teaspoon there it is 1 teaspoon I'm gonna do this for vanilla and then 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of corn syrup. When it comes to recipes you always want to make sure you're going in order so now that I'm added the vanilla and corn syrup. I want to see what's next, blend in baking soda so we go back to the front of the recipe to see how much baking soda so now I'm gonna put in 2 teaspoons baking soda and it said blend so I'm also gonna turn on the mixer to blend it all together.</p>
				<p>All right I am now blending it all together I'm gonna look at our recipe card to see what our next step is while it's blending. That beep was our ovens telling me that it's preheated and ready. It now says to stir in peanut butter and oats and mix so I'm gonna add in one and a half cups of peanut butter and four and a half cups. All right I'm going to show you how all those ingredients are mixing together that's our peanut butter in our oats with everything else we've put in so far.</p>
				<p>Wow that's mixing I'm gonna look at our recipe card to see what's next. It says blend in M&Ms, and chocolate chips so oh the sea half a cup of M&Ms, half a cup of chocolate chips. Again I know that cup means these not the spoon so I'm gonna grab a half a cup for chocolate chips and a half a cup for M&M, put them in and I'll show you the final product. All right so here's our rests or our mixture from our recipe if we followed the recipe card correctly we should have perfect cookies that come out of the oven because the last step it says to bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes we've already said our our oven for 350 degrees so i spooned the batter out onto a cookie sheet I'm gonna put them in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Don't forget to set your timer,  all right we'll see then if you follow your recipe you end up with a batch of perfect cookies.</p>
