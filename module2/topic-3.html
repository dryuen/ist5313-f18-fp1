					<h2> Benefits of Meal Planning</h2>
					<p>If you ask someone why they meal plan, you will probably get one of the following three answers:</p>
					<ol>
					<li><h3>Time</h3>Having meals planned and even prepared beforehand cuts back on time in the kitchen, as well as trying to decide the night of what to cook.</li>
					<li><h3>Money</h3>This is a big one. With meal planning, you figure out your meals, then create a grocery list based on your meals. When shopping, ONLY get those groceries. Plus, if you have a plan ready, you are less likely to eat out...as that gets expensive!</li>
					<li><h3>Nutrition</h3>Planning meals ahead of time helps you to make sure you have the healthy foods you need. Plus, as said before, you will eat out less. Eating out can be very unhealthy!</li>
					</ol>
					<p>There are several types of meal planning. Depending on your time and lifestyle, choosing one or different ones through your week may be helpful.</p>
					<h4>Frozen Meals (Prep before and then bake)</h4>
					<p>This is useful for when you don't wish to prepare meals throughout the week, as well as for prepping many meals at once. You can easily have 5 meals prepped in a few hours time for under $100.</p>
					<h4>Quick 15 minute dinners</h4>
					<p>Having a few quick, simple recipes as go-tos is a great way to put dinners together.</p>

    			<p>Hello so I'm going to be showing you how to use Google sheets to create a meal planning sheet. What you would do is you'd have two tabs on the bottom, you have weekly meals and recipes. For weekly meals, fill out monday through Sunday and then breakfast lunch and dinner and you can type in what you have for each day. You can see I've put leftovers on certain days, if you're really doing a good meal plan you make leftover so you can have them for lunch the next day.</p>
				<p>So once you have your meal planning sheet you'll  go down to recipes and this is kind of where it's going to take the most time to do. You want to fill out your entire recipes list with your ingredients, the quantity for that recipe that each ingredient needs. For example you see it pizza rolls the  ingredients needed, the honey barbecue slow cooker chicken wings; so it has all the ingredients here including the quantity and the unit that we're using. When I say a pack of croissants I mean the actual package that I would come into. You can also see there's tablespoons and teaspoons other things that will help with that. Notice on instead of using fractions on the Google here, I use decimals, that's going to help the sheet to calculate a lot easier than actually doing fractions. So make sure you use that to do. You want to keep your units labeled as they should be. So again with the decimals make sure you have that added.</p>
				<p>So what we're gonna do now is, we're going to show you how are you gonna make your grocery list based on the ingredients that you need for your menu. So you're gonna go to data and you're going to click on pivot table. Pivot table is going to be where you calculate your information. So you're going to go over to the right where it says the enter to the data. So what data are you going to use well you'll go back to your tables go down to recipes or whatever your tab was and you're gonna click on ingredients, quantity, and unit. These three things are going to be needed so you can make sure that you get the right amount of ingredients that you need for each recipe. So you click those and then you'll go ahead and go back, they'll go to okay.</p> 
				<p>Then once you have that we're gonna click we're gonna create our rows you can do it rows or columns as you see when I click on columns ingredients it makes a very long column here and that's kind of hard to read. So we'll go ahead and create rows so it's visually easier to read. Here so you're gonna add ingredients, you're gonna add quantity and you're gonna add the unit so that we have all three of those there. So you can see here it shows every item and it is listed in alphabetical order so you can kind of see everything that you need. If you notice it has all the items and the decimals and also notice that it adds we can add our total. So earlier I had one of my recipes called for three eggs and another recipe called for six eggs so what I want to do is I want to show that added up so that I can easily make sure I get the right amount of item. So I'm gonna go to values on the right hand side and I'm gonna click on quantity and I'm gonna summarize that I'm gonna change it to sum, which means that I'm going to add all the total items that I need for each each ingredient. You can see when I do that down here on the bottom it changes to nine so it's adding the total items that I need, this is very very helpful when you are having a lot of recipes that that call for the same ingredients. Okay so we have our total ingredients quality.</p> 
				<p>There's a lot of different ways you can make the font bigger, you can make it visually appealing this is just the very simplified form of showing you how you create your meal plan, how you have your recipes, and how you would be able to calculate to easily identify what you need for your things. You can even change it up with your data you let's say I only want to get find out what I need for about a pizza rolls or if I want to find out what I need for four meals you easily just go back into the pivot form just change what data you're using and you click OK. You'll go back and see what ingredients you need so you can easily change what you need for your groceries. So you have your weekly meal spreadsheet, easy to fill in. And like I said leftovers are the big thing for me so it's easy easy to remember to do. And then you have your recipes and like I said this is going to be the most time-consuming it's just filling in all of those ingredients that you need for your meals. This is going to be something that would be a running sheet that you would always have available. Thank you for watching!</p>
